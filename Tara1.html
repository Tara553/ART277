<h3>Travelling in Depression </h3>
<!-- My heading 3 end here -->

<p>When I was very little, I caught the travvel bug. It started after my grandparents first brought me too  their home in France and I have now been to twety-nine different countries. Each has given me a unique learning experience. </p>

<p>At five, i <a href="https://starzit.com">marvel</a> at the Eiffel Tower in the city of Lights. When I was eight, I stood in the <br> heart of Piazza San Marco feeding hordes of pigeons, then glided down Venetian waterways on sleek  gondolas. At thirteen, I saw the aciennt, megalithic structure of stonehenge and <br> <a href="https://starzit.com"><img src="girl.jpeg.jpg" alt="girl.png" title="girl" style="width: 200px; height: 220px; float: left; margin-top:10px; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 27px;"></a> walked along the great wall o China, amazed that the thousand-years-old stones were still in place just as it is in <br> <a href="https://starzit.com">Starz University</a> <br><br> It was through exploring cultures around the world that I first became intersted in language. <br><br> It begain with French, which thaught me the importance of pronounciation. I remember once asking a stone owner in paris Where Rue des Pyramides was. But when I pronounced it PYR-a-mides instead of pyr-A-mides, with more accent on the A, she looked at me bewildered.   </p>
<p>In the eight grade, I became fascinated with spanish and aware of its similaritieswith English through cognates. <br> Baseball in Spanish, for example, is beisbol, which looks different but sounds nearly the same. This was incredible to me as it made speech and conprehension more fluid, and today I find that cognates come to the rescure whhen I forgot how to say something in Spanish. <a href="mailto:jeremiedavis53@gmail.com">Send us mail</a></p>
<p>Then, in high school, I developed an enthusiasm for Chinese. As I studied Chinese at my school, I marveled how if just one stroke was missing from a character, the meaning is lost. I loved how long words were formed by combining simpler characters, so Huǒ (火) meaning fire and Shān (山) meaning mountain can be joined to create Huǒshān (火山), which means volcano. I love spending hours at a time practicing the characters and I can feel the beauty and rhythm as I form them.</p>
