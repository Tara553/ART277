                    When I was very little, I caught the travvel bug. It started after my grandparents first brought me too their home in France and 
                    I have now been to twety-nine different countries. 
                    Each has given me a unique learning experience.

                    At five, i <a href="https://starzit.com/">marvel</a> at the Eiffel Tower in the city of Lights. When I was eight, I stood in the
                    <br />
                    heart of Piazza San Marco feeding hordes of pigeons, then glided down Venetian waterways on sleek gondolas. 
                    <br />
                    At thirteen, I saw the aciennt, megalithic structure of stonehenge and

                    walked along the great wall o China, amazed that the thousand-years-old stones were still in place just as it is in

                    It was through exploring cultures around the world that I first became intersted in language.

                    It begain with French, which thaught me the importance of pronounciation. 
                    I remember once asking a stone owner in paris Where Rue des Pyramides was. But when I pronounced it PYR-a-mides instead of pyr-A-mides, with more accent on the A, she looked at me bewildered.

                    In the eight grade, I became fascinated with spanish and aware of its similaritieswith English through cognates.
                    Baseball in Spanish, for example, is beisbol, which looks different but sounds nearly the same. This was incredible to me as it made speech and conprehension more fluid, and today I find that cognates come to the rescure whhen I forgot how to say something in Spanish. <a href="https://starzit.com/">Send us mail</a>

                    Then, in high school, I developed an enthusiasm for Chinese. As I studied Chinese at my school, I marveled how if just one stroke was missing from a character, the meaning is lost. I loved how long words were formed by combining simpler characters, so Huǒ (火) meaning fire and Shān (山) meaning mountain can be joined to create Huǒshān (火山), which means volcano. I love spending hours at a time practicing the characters and I can feel the beauty and rhythm as I form them.
